This is a **starter template** for building React applications using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/) (a UI library built on Tailwind CSS). It provides a modern development environment with sensible defaults to kickstart your projects.

**✨ Features**
